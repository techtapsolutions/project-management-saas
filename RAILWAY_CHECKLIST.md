- **SSL certificates**: Included automatically

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Build Failures:**
- Check Node.js version compatibility (requires >= 18)
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check build command in railway.toml
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- Ensure no typos in variable names
- Verify Railway service references (${{service.url}})
- Check that secrets are properly generated
- Confirm DATABASE_URL is set automatically

**Database Connection Errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check DATABASE_URL format
- Ensure Prisma schema is deployed
- Try manual database connection test

**CORS Errors:**
- Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes frontend URL
- Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL points to correct backend
- Ensure both services are using HTTPS URLs

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… Both services build and deploy without errors
- âœ… Frontend loads and displays properly
- âœ… User registration and login work
- âœ… Database operations complete successfully
- âœ… Services communicate properly (no CORS errors)
- âœ… Application functionality matches local development
